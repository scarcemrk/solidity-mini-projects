## About

This repository is designed to offer practical learning through small, complete Solidity projects.
Each mini project targets one or more key concepts and security patterns.

What you'll find:

- 📄 Clean, functional smart contracts
- 📘 Simple explanations and usage guides
- 🔐 Best practices for writing secure and efficient code

## Projects

### 📌 Project 1 – CryptoWallet *(Level: Intermediate)*

A simple ETH wallet contract with:

- Per-user daily withdrawal limits
- Owner-based internal transfers
- Access control and error handling


---

### 📌 Project 2 – Student Portal *(Level: Beginner → Intermediate)*

A student management contract featuring:

- Structs, mappings, arrays, and inheritance
- Attendance & grade tracking per wallet address


---

### 📌 Project 3 – Oracle Integration *(Level: Intermediate)*

A demo of integrating external data using interfaces:

- Mock ETH-INR price oracle
- Safe consumption and modular contract design


---

## Roadmap

Planned upcoming mini projects:

- 🧪 Token contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721)
- 🔐 Access control & upgradability patterns
- 🔗 Chainlink / oracle-based utilities
- 🛠️ Advanced gas optimizations & design patterns
